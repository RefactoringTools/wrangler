Installation
-------------

Note: Intallation of Erlang and Emacs (or XEmacs) is required in order to use 
      Wrangler.  

Step 1) Build and install the software in the usual way:
       ./configure && make && [sudo] make install

       (NOTE: by default Wrangler is installed in the directory 
        'usr/local'; to install Wrangler in a different directory, 
         you need to explicitly specify the directory using the 
         'prefix' flag of 'configure')

Step 2) If you have Erlang mode for Emacs installed, goto Step 3); 
     	otherwise add the following lines to your ~/.emacs 
	(or ~/.xemacs/init.el for XEmacs) file.
	

        (setq load-path (cons  "/usr/local/otp/lib/tools-<ToolsVer>/emacs"
	    	      load-path))
        (setq erlang-root-dir "/usr/local/otp")
        (setq exec-path (cons "/usr/local/otp/bin" exec-path))
        (require 'erlang-start)
  
        (NOTE: we assume Erlang/OTP is installed in the directory 
	 '/usr/local/otp', please substitute with the correct path 
         if your Erlang/OTP is installed in a different directory; 
         you also have to replace <ToosVer> with the correct 
         version number)   
	

Step 3) Add these lines to your ~/.emacs (or ./.xemacs/init.el for XEmacs):
	    
        (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/wrangler/elisp")
        (require 'wrangler)
   
       (If you used an install prefix other than '/usr/local', replace
       '/usr/local/' with the correct directory)

Step 4) Wrangler requires a .erlang.cookie file in your $HOME directory, 
        please create one if it does not exist. The .erlang.cookie 
	file should contain a single Erlang atom.
     
You should now be able to use Wrangler. For problems and bug reports, 
please send a note to 'hl@kent.ac.uk' or 'erlang-refactor@kent.ac.uk'.
