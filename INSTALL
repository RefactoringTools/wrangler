Installation
-------------

Note: Installation of Erlang and Emacs (or XEmacs) is required in order to use 
      Wrangler.  

Step 1) Build and install the software in the usual way:
       ./configure && make && [sudo] make install

       (NOTE: by default Wrangler is installed in the directory 
        'usr/local'; to install Wrangler in a different directory, 
         you need to explicitly specify the directory using the 
         'prefix' flag of 'configure')

Step 2) If you have Erlang mode for Emacs installed, goto Step 3); 
     	otherwise add the following lines to your ~/.emacs 
	(or ~/.xemacs/init.el for XEmacs) file.
	

        (setq load-path (cons  "/usr/local/otp/lib/tools-<ToolsVer>/emacs"
	    	      load-path))
        (setq erlang-root-dir "/usr/local/otp")
        (setq exec-path (cons "/usr/local/otp/bin" exec-path))
        (require 'erlang-start)
  
        (NOTE: we assume Erlang/OTP is installed in the directory 
	 '/usr/local/otp', please substitute with the correct path 
         if your Erlang/OTP is installed in a different directory; 
         you also have to replace <ToosVer> with the correct 
         version number)   
	

Step 3) Add these lines to your ~/.emacs (or ./.xemacs/init.el for XEmacs):
	    
        (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/wrangler/elisp")
        (require 'wrangler)

       Some code inspection functionalities of Wrangler generate .dot files, 
       which can be compiled and previewed in Emacs if the Graphviz mode for 
       Emacs is enabled. If you would like to enable the Graphviz mode for 
       Emacs, add the following line into your .emacs.

       (load-file "/usr/local/share/wrangler/elisp/graphviz-dot-mode.el")
   
       (NOTE: If you used an install prefix other than '/usr/local', replace
       '/usr/local/' with the correct directory)

Step 4) Wrangler requires a .erlang.cookie file in your $HOME directory, 
        please create one if it does not exist. The .erlang.cookie 
	file should contain a single Erlang atom.
     
You should now be able to use Wrangler. For problems and bug reports, 
please send a note to 'hl@kent.ac.uk' or 'erlang-refactor@kent.ac.uk'.
