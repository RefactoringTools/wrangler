Installation
-------------

Requirements: In order to use Wrangler, you must first have working
	      installations of Erlang and Emacs (or XEmacs). If you use
		  Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), you will need to use the flag 
		  --enable-darwin-64bit in building Erlang.

Step 1) Build and optionally install the software in the usual way:

	./configure && make && sudo make install

	By default Wrangler is installed under the directory '/usr/local';
	to install Wrangler in a different directory, you need to explicitly
	specify the directory using the '--prefix=...' flag of 'configure'.)

        If you do not install Wrangler as part of your existing Erlang
        installation (the default location), then please make sure that
        Erlang can find Wrangler in its code path. This can e.g. be done by
        including a line like the following in your ~/.erlang file:

        code:add_path("/path/to/wrangler/ebin").

        (Don't forget to substitute the location of your Wrangler directory
        for "/path/to/wrangler" above.)

        Another way is to set the environment variable ERL_LIBS to the path
        to a directory under which you keep one or more Erlang libraries.
        E.g., if your Wrangler directory is ~/erlang/lib/wrangler, then
        setting ERL_LIBS to ~/erlang/lib will make Erlang automatically add
        ~/erlang/lib/wrangler/ebin to the code path on startup.

Step 2) If you already have Erlang mode for Emacs installed, go to Step 3;
	otherwise add the following lines to your ~/.emacs file (or
	~/.xemacs/init.el for XEmacs):

	(setq erlang-root-dir "/usr/local/lib/erlang")
	(add-to-list 'exec-path "/usr/local/lib/erlang/bin")
        (add-to-list 'load-path
          "/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/tools-<ToolsVer>/emacs")
	(require 'erlang-start)

	NOTE: you have to replace <ToolsVer> in the above with the correct
	version number. Also, if Erlang/OTP is not installed in the
	directory '/usr/local/lib/erlang' on your system, please substitute
	the correct path.

Step 3) Add these lines to your ~/.emacs (or ./.xemacs/init.el for XEmacs):

     	(add-to-list 'load-path
          "/usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/wrangler-<WranglerVer>/elisp")
	(require 'wrangler)

	replacing <WranglerVer> with the correct version number. If you
        installed Wrangler in a different location (or did not run "make
        install"), then please substitute the correct path for your system.

Step 4) Wrangler includes a version of Distel. If you have a more recent
        version of Distel that you want to use instead, please make sure
        that your version occurs before Wrangler *both* in the Emacs
        load-path and in the Erlang code path. The latter can be done by
        including a line like the following in your ~/.erlang file:

        code:add_patha("/path/to/distel/ebin").

        (note: 'add_patha', not 'add_path'!), replacing "/path/to/distel"
        with the location of your preferred Distel installation.

        There is no need to call "(require 'distel)" or "(distel-setup)" in
        your .emacs if you call "(require 'wrangler)" - this is done
        automatically, loading the Distel elisp files from the load-path
        that you have set in your .emacs file. E.g.,:

	(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/distel/elisp")

        Make sure that this is called *after* the Wrangler directory is
        added to the load-path (since add-to-list prepends new entries), but
        *before* the call to "(require 'wrangler)".

Step 5) Some code inspection functionalities of Wrangler generate .dot
	files, which can be compiled and previewed in Emacs if the
	Graphviz-dot mode for Emacs is enabled. If you would like to enable
	the Graphviz-dot mode, add the following line to your ~/.emacs file:

	(load-library "graphviz-dot-mode")

Step 6) Wrangler requires an .erlang.cookie file in your $HOME directory,
	please create one if it does not exist. An easy way of doing this is
	to start Erlang once in distributed mode: e.g., `erl -sname foo',
	which will generate a random string. Or you can choose your own
	string for the cookie, e.g., `echo "foobar" > .erlang.cookie'.

You should now be able to use Wrangler. For problems and bug reports, please
send a note to 'hl@kent.ac.uk' or 'erlang-refactor@kent.ac.uk'.
