Installation
-------------

Requirements: In order to use Wrangler, you must first have working
	      installations of Erlang and Emacs (or XEmacs).

Step 1) Build and optionally install the software in the usual way:

	./configure && make && sudo make install

	By default Wrangler is installed in the directory 'usr/local'; to
	install Wrangler in a different directory, you need to explicitly
	specify the directory using the '--prefix=...' flag of 'configure'.)

Step 2) If you already have Erlang mode for Emacs installed, go to Step 3);
	otherwise add the following lines to your ~/.emacs file (or
	~/.xemacs/init.el for XEmacs):

	(setq load-path (cons  "/usr/local/erlang/lib/tools-<ToolsVer>/emacs"
		      load-path))
	(setq erlang-root-dir "/usr/local/erlang")
	(setq exec-path (cons "/usr/local/erlang/bin" exec-path))
	(require 'erlang-start)

	NOTE: you have to replace <ToolsVer> in the above with the correct
	version number. Also, if Erlang/OTP is not installed in the
	directory '/usr/local/erlang', please substitute the correct path.

Step 3) Add these lines to your ~/.emacs (or ./.xemacs/init.el for XEmacs):

	(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/share/wrangler/elisp")
	(require 'wrangler)

	If you installed Wrangler somewhere else than `/usr/local', please
        replace `/usr/local' above with the correct path for your system.

	Some code inspection functionalities of Wrangler generate .dot
	files, which can be compiled and previewed in Emacs if the
	Graphviz-dot mode for Emacs is enabled. If you would like to enable
	the Graphviz-dot mode, add the following line to your .emacs file:

	(load-library "graphviz-dot-mode")

Step 4) Wrangler requires an .erlang.cookie file in your $HOME directory,
	please create one if it does not exist. An easy way of doing this is
	to start Erlang once in distributed mode: e.g., `erl -sname foo',
	which will generate a random string. Or you can choose your own
	string for the cookie, e.g., `echo "foobar" > .erlang.cookie'.

You should now be able to use Wrangler. For problems and bug reports, please
send a note to 'hl@kent.ac.uk' or 'erlang-refactor@kent.ac.uk'.
