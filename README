                a snapshot of our current prototype

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wrangler is an Erlang refactoring tool that supports interactive
refactoring of Erlang programs.  The current snapshot of Wrangler 
supports a number of basic Erlang refactorings, including 
renaming variable/function/module names, generalisation of a 
function definition, function extraction, folding against a function 
definition, duplicated code detection, etc.

Wrangler is embedded in the Emacs editing environment, and built on
top of Distel, an Emacs-based user interface toolkit for Erlang, to
manage to communication between the refactoring tool and
Emacs. We are now also in the process of integrating Wrangler with 
the Eclipse environment.

--------------------- how to build  ----------------------------

  See INSTALL 

--------------------- the directory structure -------------------

  INSTALL             <-  installation instructions 
  Makefile.in 
  README              <-  README file of Wrangler (you're reading this)
  configure           <-  configure file
  c_src               <-  C source code
  doc                 <-  documentation
  ebin                <-  directory for Erlang beam files
  elisp               <-  elisp source files
  include             <-  Erlang .hrl files
  plt                 <-  Side-effect table used by Wrangler
  src                 <-  Erlang source files

--------------------- how to use the refactorer ----------------

  1. Open an Erlang source file in the Emacs editor, you should have a
     menu called 'Erlang'.

  2. To start the Erlang refactorer:

      M-x erlang-refactor-on  

     After that, two menus, 'Refactor' and 'Inspector' should appear in the menu bar.
    
  3. To stop the Erlang refactorer:
     
      M-x erlang-refactor-off 

      'Refactor' and 'Inspector' will disappear in the menu bar.

  4. You could also use "Ctrl-c Ctrl-r" to toggle the refactorer on/off.
 
  5. For most refactorings, the editor interface will pass the
     current filename (should be the module name, as well), the
     refactoring command, and the current cursor position. For
     some refactorings, you'll also need to highlight an 
     expression, or enter a new name. Here's the current list:

     Rename variable/function   : place cursor at the identifier to
                                  be renamed, you'll be prompted for a
                                  new name.

     Rename module              : place cursor at anywhere within the
                                  module, you'll be prompted for a new 
				  name.

     Generalise definition       : highlight the expression on which
                                  the function is going to be
                                  generalised, you'll be prompted for
                                  a new parameter name.
     Move a function definition
     to another module          : place cursor at anywhere within the
                                  function definition, you'll be
                                  prompted for the target module name.

     Function extraction        : highlight the expression/expression
	                          sequence that you wish to extract,
	                          you'll be prompted for a new function
                                  name.
     Fold expression against 
     function                   : place cursor at anywhere at the function
                                  clause. Wrangler will guide you through 
	                          the possible candidates one by one, and 
                                  ask whether you want to fold it or not.

     Introduce new macro        : highlight the expression/pattern that you
                                  wish to replace with macro application, and
                                  you'll be prompted from a new macro name.

     Fold against macro def     : place cursor at anywhere at the function
                                  definition. Wrangler will direct you through
                                  the possible candidates one by one, and for 
                                  each candidate ask whether you want to fold
                                  it or not. 


     Tuple function arguments   : highlight the sequence of parameters to be grouped 
                                  into a tuple from the function definition, then
                                  select the refactoring command from the menu.
     

     Identical expression search : highlight the expression/expression sequence
	                           you are interested, Wrangler will show you 
	                           the found expression/expression sequences. 

     Detect identical code  
     in current buffer          : select the refactoring command from the 
                                  menu, you'll be prompted for the minimum 
	                          number of tokens a duplicated code fragment 
                                  should have, and the number of times that a 
                                  code fragment is duplicated.
                                  
     Detect identical code 
     in Dirs                    : select the refactoring command from the menu,
	                          and you will be prompted for the minimum 
                                  number of tokens a duplicated code fragment 
                                  should have, and the minimum number of times  
                                  that a code fragment is duplicated. Wrangler 
                                  searches duplicated code fragments from the 
                                  directories specified by the search-paths (see 
                                  Customize Wrangler).

     Similar expression search  : highlight the expression/expression sequence you 
                                  are interested, select the command from the menu, 
                                  and Wrangler will prompt you to input a similarity 
                                  score.

     Detect similar code in     : select the refactoring command from the menu, and
     current buffer              you'll be prompted for 3 parameters, i.e the minimum 
                                  number of expressions in a expression sequence, the 
                                  minimum number of times clones, and a similarity 
                                  score.

     Detect similar code in     : select the refactoring command from the menu, and
     dirs                         you'll be prompted for 3 parameters, i.e the minimum 
                                  number of expressions in a expression sequence, the 
                                  minimum number of times clones, and a similarity 
                                  score. Wrangler searches similar code fragments from 
                                  the directories specified by the search-paths (see
                                  Customize Wrangler).

	                        
     Rename a process           :place the cursor at the process name
                                 to be renamed, and you will be
                                 prompted for the new name.

     Register a process         :highlight the match expression whose
                                 right-hand side is the spawn
                                 expression that creates the process,
                                 and left-hand side is the process
                                 identifier, and you will be prompted
                                 for the new process name.
 
     From fun to process        :place the cursor at the function name
                                 of the function definition to be
                                 refactored, and you will be prompted
                                 for the new process name.

    Add tag to messages         :place the cursor at the function
                                 whose body contains the receive
                                 expression of the server process, and
                                 you will be prompted for the tag name.
     

 6. The 'Customize Wrangler' menu in the 'Refactor' submenu allows you specify 
 the boundary of the system by giving the list of directories to
 search for Erlang source files/header files that could be affected by a
 refactoring.
