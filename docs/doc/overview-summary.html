<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>Refactoring is the process of improving the design of a program without
changing its external behaviour. While refactoring by hand is possible, tool
support for refactoring is invaluable as it is more reliable, and allows
refactoring to be done (or undone) easily. Wrangler is such a tool that
supports interactive refactoring of Erlang programs. Wrangler currently
supports a number of basic Erlang refactorings, such as renaming of
variable/function/module names, generalisation of a function definition,
function extraction, folding against a function definition, duplicated code
detection, etc.</p>

<p>Wrangler also provides a set of process-based refactorings, including the
 introduction of process naming, instead of providing access to a process 
only through a dynamically-generated <em>process id</em> Wrangler also contains 
a variety of refactorings which work with Erlang QuickCheck, introducing
 and merging constructs such as <code>?LET</code> and <code>?FORALL</code>.</p>

<p>Transforming data types in Erlang can be difficult, as Erlang functions 
can take values of any type, in principle. There are situations -- particularly 
in implementing an Erlang <em>behaviour </em>, which can be thought of as an 
interface for a set of callback functions -- where the types are more 
constrained, and where data transformations are possible. In particular 
we have implemented transformations for <em>state data</em> in various kinds 
of generic state machine in both the OTP library and QuickCheck. </p>

<p>In implementing Wrangler we have chosen to respect various features of 
the language and related tools. Wrangler is able to process modules which 
use <em>macros</em>, including the Erlang test frameworks that are in 
regular use. Wrangler also respects the naming conventions in those 
test frameworks.</p>

<p>Wrangler provides a portfolio of decision support tools. The code inspector 
highlights local <em>code smells</em> and a number of reports highlight issues in 
the module structure of projects, including circular inclusions and other 
potential faults. The code clone detection facilities can be 
used on large multi-module projects to report on code clones and how they 
can be removed; clone detection can be preformed incrementally on larger code 
bases, for example as part of a continuous integration approach to software 
construction. </p>


<p>Wrangler has recently been extended with a framework that allows users to define 
for themselves refactorings and code inspection functions that suit their 
needs. These are defined using a template- and rule-based 
program transformation and analysis API. Wrangler also supports a  
domain-specific language that allows users to script composite refactorings, 
test them and apply them on the fly. 
User-defined refactorings and scripts are not <em>second-class citizens</em>: like 
the existing Wrangler refactorings, user-defined refactorings  benefit 
from features such as results preview, layout preservation, selective 
refactoring, undo and so on. </p>


<p>Built on top of the functionalities provided by the Erlang <em>syntax-tools</em>
package, Wrangler is embedded in the Emacs/Xemacs editing environment, and
makes use of the functionalities provided by Distel, an Emacs-based user
interface toolkit for Erlang, to manage the communication between the
refactoring tool and Emacs. Wrangler is also integrated within
Eclipse, as a part of the ErlIDE plugin for Erlang. </p>

<h3><a name="The_Interface_of_Wrangler">The Interface of Wrangler</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Wrangler_in_Emacs">Wrangler in Emacs</a></h4><p>
Below is a snapshot of Wrangler embedded in Emacs, which shows a particular
refactoring scenario. The user has selected the expression <code>
io:format("Hello") </code> in the definition of <code> repeat/1 </code>, has
chosen the <em>Generalise Function Definition </em> command from the <em>
Refactor </em> sub-menu, and has just entered a new parameter name A in the
mini-buffer.</p>

<p><img src="Wrangler1.JPG" alt="selecting a refactoring from the Emacs menu"> </p>

<p>The result of this refactoring is shown in the snapshot below.</p>

<p><img src="Wrangler2.JPG" alt="Emacs buffers after running the refactoring"> </p>

<p>Preview of the changes to be made by a refactoring is supported, and the
user could choose to commit or abort the refactoring result after preview.
Wrangler's preview uses the Ediff package for Emacs.</p>

<p>All the implemented refactorings are module-aware. In the case that a
refactoring affects more than one module in the program, a message telling
which files have been modified by the refactorer will be given after the
refactoring has been successfully done. The <em>Customize Wrangler</em>
command from the <em>Refactor</em> sub-menu allows the user to specify the
boundary of the program, i.e., the directories that will be searched and
analysed by the refactorer, as shown in the example snapshot below.</p>

<p><img src="customize.JPG" alt="customizing Wrangler behaviour in Emacs"> </p>

<p><em>Undo</em> is supported by the refactorer. Applying undo once will revert
the program back to the status right before the last refactoring performed.
However, <em>PLEASE NOTE</em> that the refactorer undo is currently separate
from the Emacs undo, and undoing a refactoring will lose all the editing
activities after the refactoring.</p>

Below is a snapshot of Wrangler embedded in Eclipse + Erlide.</p>

<h3><a name="Support_for_Macros">Support for Macros</a></h3>

<p>Wrangler makes use of functionalities provided by the <code>epp_dodger</code> module
from the Erlang <code>syntax_tools</code> library to parse Erlang source code, and
should be able to refactor Erlang modules containing preprocessor directives
and macro applications, as long as the macro definitions are syntactically
"well-behaved".</p>

<h3><a name="Refactoring_Code_with_Syntax_Errors">Refactoring Code with Syntax Errors</a></h3>

<p>Wrangler accepts Erlang programs with syntax errors or macro definitions
that cannot be parsed by <code>epp_dodger</code>. In the case that the program under
consideration has syntax errors or unparsable macros, functions/attributes
to which these syntax errors belong are not affected by the refactoring
process; however, warning messages asking for manual inspection of those
parts of the program are given after the refactoring.</p>

<h3><a name="How_to_Use_Wrangler">How to Use Wrangler</a></h3>

<ol>
 <li><p>Open an Erlang source file in the Emacs editor. You should now have a
     menu called <em>Erlang</em>, if you have configured Emacs properly to     
use the Erlang-mode (see the file INSTALL otherwise).</p>
	 
 </li>
 <li><p>To start Wrangler, type: <code>M-x erlang-wrangler-on</code>, or
     alternatively <code>Ctrl-c Ctrl-r</code>. After that, new menu <em>Wrangler</em> should appear in the     
menu bar (see INSTALL otherwise).</p>
	 
 </li>
 <li><p>To stop Wrangler, type <code>M-x erlang-wrangler-off</code>, or
     alternatively use <code>Ctrl-c Ctrl-r</code> again. The Refactor and Inspector     
menus will disappear from the menu bar.</p>
	 
 </li>
 <li><p>You can use <code>Ctrl-c Ctrl-r</code> to toggle Wrangler on or off.</p>
 
 </li>
 <li><p>For most refactorings, the editor interface will pass the current     
filename (should be the module name, as well), the refactoring command,     
and the current cursor position. For some refactorings, you'll also     
need to highlight an expression, or enter a new name.</p>
	 
 </li>
 <li><p>The <em>Customize Wrangler</em> menu in the Wrangler submenu allows you     
to specify the boundary of the system by giving the list of directories     
to search for Erlang source files/header files that could be affected     
by a refactoring.</p>
	 
 </li> 
 <li><p>For most refactorings, the editor interface will pass the current filename      
(should be the module name, as well), the refactoring command, and the current 	 
cursor position. For some refactorings, you'll also need to highlight an      
expression, or enter a new name. </p>
