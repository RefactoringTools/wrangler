%% Function: start(Type, StartArgs) -> {ok, Pid} |
%%                                     {ok, Pid, State} |

%% Description: This function is called whenever an application 
%% is started using application:start/1,2, and should start the processes
%% of the application. If the application is structured according to the
%% OTP design principles as a supervision Tree, this means starting the
%% top supervisor of the tree.
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------
start(_Type, _Args) ->
    error_logger:tty(false),
    wrangler_sup:start().
    
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Function: stop(State) -> void()
%% Description: This function is called whenever an application
%% has stopped. It is intended to be the opposite of Module:start/2 and
%% should do any necessary cleaning up. The return value is ignored.
