%% This module shows how to use Wrangler's refactoring 
%% level API to compose more complex refactorings.
%% This example refactoring tries to rename all the 
%% function names that are in camlCase format to camel_case
%% format. An error message is issued each time the 
%% refactoring fails to rename a function because of 
%% name conflict.
%%
%% This refactoring is supposed to run in command line.
%% Before run this refactoring, you can use
%% wrangler_api:start() to start the Wrangler application.
%% Doing this will allow you to undo the refactoring 
%% if you are not happy with the result; and when you 
%% finish, you can use wrangler_api:stop() to stop the 
%% wrangler application.
