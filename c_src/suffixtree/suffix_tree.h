/******************************************************************************/
/* 
   ST_CreateTree :
   Allocates memory for the tree and starts Ukkonen's construction algorithm by
   calling SPA n times, where n is the length of the source string.

   Input : The source string and its length. The string is a sequence of
           characters (maximum of 256 different symbols) and not
           null-terminated. The only symbol that must not appear in the string
           is $ (the dollar sign). It is used as a unique symbol by the
           algorithm and is appended automatically at the end of the string (by
           the program, not by the user!). The meaning of the $ sign is
           connected to the implicit/explicit suffix tree transformation,
           detailed in Ukkonen's algorithm.

   Output: A pointer to the newly created tree. Keep this pointer in order to
           perform operations like search and delete on that tree. Obviously,
           no de-allocating of the tree space could be done if this pointer is
           lost, as the tree is allocated dynamically on the heap.

   ST_FindSubstring :
   Traces for a string in the tree. This function is used for substring search
   after tree construction is done. It simply traverses down the tree starting
   from the root until either the searched string is fully found ot one
   non-matching character is found. In this function skipping is not enabled
   because we don't know wether the string is in the tree or not (see function
   trace_string above).

   Input : The tree, the string W, and the length of W.

   Output: If the substring is found - returns the index of the starting
           position of the substring in the tree source string. If the substring
           is not found - returns ST_ERROR.
